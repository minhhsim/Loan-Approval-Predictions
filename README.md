Coursework 2 for Data Analytics (SET09120) Edinburgh Napier University

The aim of this coursework is to demonstrate an understanding of OpenRefine and Weka to conduct an exploratory data mining of data 
provided and produce a report about my discoveries.

OpenRefine is to be used to clean the data provided and Weka to provide visualisation tools and algorithms for the dat analysis
and predictive modelling.
